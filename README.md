# Stock-Market-Prediction
Stock Market Prediction using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict stock prices using machine learning techniques. It utilizes historical stock data to train a predictive model and forecast future prices.

## Overview

The project leverages Python and popular libraries like pandas, scikit-learn, and matplotlib to fetch historical stock data, preprocess it, build a machine learning model, evaluate its performance, and visualize the results.
